- 27: shuffled things around into private/public folders to get in the abstraction mood. added using and bound [e] to it. added basic usable class but it doesn't do shit yet. added a basic PlayerCameraManager (which required adding a PlayerController) which ended up being an awesome wayto fix the brief camera seizures that were occuring when looking straight down at the end of an idle animation cycle.
